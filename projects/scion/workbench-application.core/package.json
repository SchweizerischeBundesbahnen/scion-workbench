  "description": "SCION Workbench Application Platform is an extension of SCION Workbench to integrate content from multiple web applications in a coherent way, thus enabling a micro frontend architecture for allowing different front-end frameworks to co-exist and independent delivery.\n\nThe platform provides the mechanics for client-side web application integration. Any web application can be integrated. If the site does not interact with the platform, there is no need for adaptation. For a deeper integration, the platform provides a framework-agnostic guest API.\n\nThis package allows an application to interact with SCION Workbench Application Platform. It is written in pure TypeScript.",
