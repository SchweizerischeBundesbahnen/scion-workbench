SCION Workbench Client
======================

SCION Workbench Client provides core API for a web app to interact with [SCION Workbench][link-scion-workench] and other microfrontends. It is a pure TypeScript library based on the framework-agnostic [SCION Microfrontend Platform][link-scion-microfrontend-platform] library and can be used with any web stack.

Although SCION Workbench is designed for use in Angular applications, its workbench layout is particularly well suited for implementing a framework-agnostic microfrontend architecture, as different web applications can contribute views in the form of microfrontends. SCION Workbench has built-in microfrontend support from the [SCION Microfrontend Platform][link-scion-microfrontend-platform], a lightweight library for embedding microfrontends. Microfrontends embedded as views can interact seamlessly with the workbench using the SCION Workbench Client or communicate with other microfrontends via the SCION Microfrontend Platform. Any web application can be integrated as a workbench view. Likewise, a workbench view can embed further microfrontends, and so on.
