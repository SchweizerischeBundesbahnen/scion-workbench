/**
 * Configures the content and appearance of a message presented to the user in the form of a message box.
 *
 * A message box is a modal dialog box that an application can use to display a message to the user. It typically contains a text
 * message and one or more buttons.
 *
 * The workbench supports the following two modality types:
 *
 * - **Application-modal:**
 *   An application-modal message box blocks the entire workbench. The user cannot switch between views, close or open views,
 *   or arrange views in the workbench layout.
 *
 * - **View-modal:**
 *   A view-modal message box blocks only the view in which it was opened. In contrast to application-modal message boxes, the user
 *   can interact with other views, close them or open new views, or arrange them any other way. A view-modal message box sticks to
 *   its view; that is, it is displayed only when the view is visible. By default, when opening the message box in the context of a
 *   view, it is opened as a view-modal message box. When opened outside of a view, setting the modality to 'view' has no effect.
