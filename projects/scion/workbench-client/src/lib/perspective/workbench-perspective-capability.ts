    /**
     * Defines the layout of this perspective.
     *
     * A perspective defines an arrangement of parts and views. Parts can be docked to the side or positioned relative to each other.
     * Views are stacked in parts and can be dragged to other parts. Content can be displayed in both parts and views.
     *
     * Users can personalize the layout of a perspective and switch between perspectives. The workbench remembers the last layout of each perspective,
     * restoring it the next time it is activated.
     *
     * A perspective typically has a main area part and other parts docked to the side, providing navigation and context-sensitive assistance to support
     * the user's workflow. Initially empty or displaying a welcome page, the main area is where the workbench opens new views by default.
     * Unlike any other part, the main area is shared between perspectives, and its layout is not reset when resetting perspectives.
     *
     * ## Example
     * The following example defines a layout with a main area and three parts:
     *
     * ```plain
     * +--------+----------------+
     * |  top   |                |
     * |  left  |                |
     * |--------+   main area    |
     * | bottom |                |
     * |  left  |                |
     * +--------+----------------+
     * |          bottom         |
     * +-------------------------+
