/**
 * A view is a visual workbench component for displaying content stacked or arranged side by side in the workbench layout.
 *
 * If a microfrontend lives in the context of a workbench view, regardless of its embedding level, it can inject an instance
 * of this class to interact with the workbench view, such as setting view tab properties or closing the view. It further
 * provides you access to the microfrontend capability and passed parameters.
 *
 * This object's lifecycle is bound to the workbench view and not to the navigation. In other words: If using hash-based routing
 * in your app, no new instance will be constructed when navigating to a different microfrontend of the same application, or when
 * re-routing to the same view capability, e.g., for updating the browser URL to persist navigation. Consequently, do not forget
 * to unsubscribe from Observables of this class before displaying another microfrontend.
