   * If you use an element as the popup anchor, the popup also moves when the anchor element moves. If you use a coordinate
   * and open the popup in the context of a view, the popup opens relative to the bounds of that view. Otherwise, it
   * is positioned relative to the page viewport. If you move or resize the view or the page, the popup will also be moved
   * depending on the pair of coordinates used.
   *
   * The following coordinate pairs are supported:
   * - x/y: relative to the "top/left" corner of the view or page viewport
   * - top/left: equivalent to passing a "x/y" coordinate
   * - top/right: relative to the "top/right" corner of the view or page viewport
   * - bottom/left: relative to the "bottom/left" corner of the view or page viewport
   * - bottom/right: relative to the "bottom/right" corner of the view or page viewport
   *
   * Positioning the popup using coordinates allows to pass an Observable to update the popup position. Note that the popup
   * will not display until the Observable emits the first coordinate.
