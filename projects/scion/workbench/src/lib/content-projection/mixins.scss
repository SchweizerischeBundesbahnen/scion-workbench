/**
 * Pointer events are ignored in 'activity part' and 'viewpart-grid' to allow interaction with projected content.
 * Projected content is out of the element flow and added to a top-level workbench DOM element. It is projected
 * into respective view or activity bounding box.
 *
 * To not cover other parts of the workbench (e.g. sashes), it is placed upfront in the DOM, which requires projection
 * areas to ignore pointer events and not to use a background color.
 *
 * Use this mixin to allow pointer events in selected areas like sashes, activity header or view tabbar.
