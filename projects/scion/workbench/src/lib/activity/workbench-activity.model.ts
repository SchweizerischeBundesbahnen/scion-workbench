/**
 * Defines the arrangement of docked parts (also referred to as activities) in the workbench.
 *
 * Docked parts can be minimized to create more space for the main content.
 *
 * A part can be docked to the left, right, or bottom side of the workbench.
 * Each side has two docking areas: `left-top` and `left-bottom`, `right-top` and `right-bottom`, and `bottom-left` and `bottom-right`.
 * Parts added to the same area are stacked, with only one part active per stack. If there is an active part in both stacks of a side,
 * the two parts are split vertically or horizontally, depending on the side.
 *
 * A docked part may be navigated to display content, have views, or define a layout with multiple parts aligned relative to each other.
 *
 * The M-prefix indicates this object is a model object that is serialized and stored, requiring migration on breaking change.
