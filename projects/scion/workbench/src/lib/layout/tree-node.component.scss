     * Unset stacking context formed by <sci-sashbox> so that sash splitters can overlap microfrontends (iframes).
     *
     * For iframe-based microfrontend integration, we cannot add iframes directly as sash content but have to project
     * iframes to the sashes boundaries instead. Internally, the sashbox sets a z-index on sash splitters to overlap sash
     * content. This, however, only applies to sash content modelled via `ng-template`.
     *
     * To make the splitters still overlap the iframes, we unset the stacking context of the sashbox component (by setting
     * `z-index` to `auto`), causing the stacking contexts formed by the splitters to become part of the workbench parent
     * stacking context.
     *
     * For more information about stacking contexts, refer to
     * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context.
