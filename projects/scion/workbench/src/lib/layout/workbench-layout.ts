/**
 * Signature of a function to provide a workbench layout.
 *
 * The workbench will invoke this function with a factory object to create the layout. The layout is immutable; each modification creates a new instance.
 *
 * The function can call `inject` to get any required dependencies.
 *
 * ## Workbench Layout
 * The workbench layout is an arrangement of parts and views. Parts can be docked to the side or positioned relative to each other.
 * Views are stacked in parts and can be dragged to other parts. Content can be displayed in both parts and views.
 *
 * The layout typically has a main area part and other parts docked to the side, providing navigation and context-sensitive assistance to support
 * the user's workflow. Initially empty or displaying a welcome page, the main area is where the workbench opens new views by default.
 * Unlike any other part, the main area is shared between perspectives, and its layout is not reset when resetting perspectives.

 * ## Steps to create the layout
 * Start by adding parts to the layout. Parts can be docked to a specific area (`left-top`, `left-bottom`, `right-top`, `right-bottom`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`)
 * or aligned relative to each other. Views can be added to any part except the main area part. To display content, navigate parts and views to registered routes.
 *
 * To maintain a clean URL, navigate parts and views in the layout to empty-path routes and use a navigation hint for differentiation.
 * - Use the `canMatchWorkbenchPart` guard to match a route only for parts navigated with a particular hint.
 * - Use the `canMatchWorkbenchView` guard to match a route only for views navigated with a particular hint.
 *
 * ## Example
 * The following example defines a layout with a main area and four parts docked to the side:
 *
 * ```plain
 * +------+-----------+------+
 * |      |           |      |
 * |      |           |      |
 * | left | main area | right|
 * |      |           |      |
 * |      |           |      |
 * +------+-----------+------+
 * |          bottom         |
 * +-------------------------+
 * ```
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
 * import {MAIN_AREA, provideWorkbench, WorkbenchLayoutFactory} from '@scion/workbench';
 *
 * bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
 *   providers: [
 *     provideWorkbench({
 *       layout: (factory: WorkbenchLayoutFactory) => factory
 *         // Add parts to dock areas on the side.
 *         .addPart(MAIN_AREA)
 *         .addPart('navigator', {dockTo: 'left-top'}, {label: 'Navigator', icon: 'folder'})
 *         .addPart('find', {dockTo: 'bottom-left'}, {label: 'Find', icon: 'search'})
 *         .addPart('inventory', {dockTo: 'right-top'}, {label: 'Inventory', icon: 'inventory'})
 *         .addPart('notifications', {dockTo: 'right-bottom'}, {label: 'Notifications', icon: 'notifications'})
 *
 *         // Add views to parts.
 *         .addView('find1', {partId: 'find'})
 *         .addView('find2', {partId: 'find'})
 *         .addView('find3', {partId: 'find'})
 *
 *         // Navigate the main area to display a welcome page.
 *         .navigatePart(MAIN_AREA, [], {hint: 'welcome'})
 *
 *         // Navigate parts to display content.
 *         .navigatePart('navigator', [], {hint: 'navigator'})
 *         .navigatePart('inventory', ['path/to/inventory'])
 *         .navigatePart('notifications', [], {hint: 'notifications'})
 *
 *         // Navigate views to display content.
 *         .navigateView('find1', ['path/to/find'])
 *         .navigateView('find2', ['path/to/find'])

 *
 *         // Activate parts to open docked parts.
 *         .activatePart('navigator')
 *         .activatePart('find')
 *         .activatePart('inventory'),
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The layout requires the following routes.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
 * import {provideRouter} from '@angular/router';
 * import {canMatchWorkbenchView, canMatchWorkbenchPart} from '@scion/workbench';
