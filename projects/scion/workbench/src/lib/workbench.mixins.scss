/**
 * By default, pointer events are ignored in 'activity-part' and 'view-part-grid' to allow
 * interaction with remote sites (implemented as iframes). They are out of the element flow (fixed positioned)
 * and are added to a top-level workbench DOM element, but are projected into the respective view or activity boundaries.
 * This for the reason that iframes would reload if moving in the DOM, e.g. when rearranging views in the grid.
 * To not cover other parts of the workbench (e.g. sashes or view dropdown menu), they are placed upfront, which requires the
 * projection area to ignore pointer events.
 *
 * Use this mixin to allow pointer events in selected areas like sashes, activity header or view tabbar.
