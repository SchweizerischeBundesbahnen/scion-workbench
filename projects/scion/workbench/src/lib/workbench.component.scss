  // For iframe-based microfrontend integration, `<wb-workbench-layout>` forms a new stacking context during a workbench drag & drop operation such
  // as dragging a view tab, moving a part splitter, or moving a message box. The stacking context, however, is local to the workbench component.
  //
  // Rationale:
  // Since we cannot add iframes directly to the view component (an iframe would reload its content if it is reparented in the DOM), we
  // add iframes after the `<wb-workbench-layout>` element and project each iframe to its view boundaries. Alternatively, if we were to add
  // iframes before the workbench layout, we would have to disable pointer events on the layout in order to interact with iframe content.
  //
  // As a consequence, the iframes now cover the view drop zones, stopping us from arranging views via drag & drop. For that reason, during drag & drop,
  // we form a new stacking context on the `<wb-workbench-layout>` element by setting its `z-index` to `1`. In turn, during drag & drop, the layout
  // will overlap the iframes, making drop zones functional and preventing iframes from consuming pointer events. However, the new stacking context
  // needs to be local to the workbench component, as `<wb-workbench-layout>` would otherwise overlap subsequent DOM elements, causing, for example,
  // drag images or message boxes to be rendered under the layout. Therefore, we add it to an element that acts as a stacking context barrier, i.e.,
  // an element with a z-index of `0`. A `z-index` of `0` is similar to the value `auto`, which means that the element is rendered in the same layer as
  // elements without an explicit z-index, while, in contrast to the value `auto`, still forming a stacking context.
