  /**
   * Configures microfrontend support in the workbench, allowing the integration of microfrontends as workbench views or

   * The workbench uses the "SCION Microfrontend Platform" for providing microfrontend support. To learn more about the
   * "SCION Microfrontend Platform", refer to https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/scion-microfrontend-platform.
   *
   * The workbench allows any web page to be embedded as a workbench view or workbench popup. The web app has to provide
   * a manifest in which it describes its views and popups. To integrate a third-party application where customization is not
   * possible, the host application can provide a manifest for that application. If embedded content needs to interact with
   * the workbench, the web app can use the library `@scion/workbench-client`, a pure TypeScript library based on the
   * web stack-agnostic `@scion/microfrontend-platform` library.
   *
   * The workbench integrates microfrontends through so-called intents, a mechanism known from Android development, enabling
   * controlled collaboration across application boundaries. "SCION Microfrontend Platform DevTools" can help to inspect
   * integrated applications and dependencies. The DevTools are available in the form of a microfrontend that can be embedded
   * like any other microfrontend. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on how to integrate
   * "SCION Microfrontend Platform DevTools".
   *
   * Typically, the host app provides API to integrated micro apps via the intent mechanism. Consider registering intent handlers
   * under the DI token {@link MICROFRONTEND_PLATFORM_POST_STARTUP}.
