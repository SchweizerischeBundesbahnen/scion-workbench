SCION Workbench
===============

SCION Workbench enables the creation of Angular web applications that require a flexible layout to arrange content side-by-side or stacked, all personalizable by the user via drag & drop.

The workbench layout is ideal for applications with non-linear workflows, enabling users to work on content in parallel. Examples include specialized business applications, scientific or development tools, as well as command & control interfaces.

In the workbench, content is displayed in views. The workbench has a main area and a peripheral area for placing views. The main area is the primary place for views to interact with the application. Typically, it is initially blank or displays a start page. The peripheral area arranges views around the main area. Peripheral views can be used to provide entry points to the application, tools or context-sensitive assistance to support the user's workflow. Multiple arrangements of peripheral views, called perspectives, are supported. Different perspectives provide a different perspective on the application while sharing the main area. Only one perspective can be active at a time.
