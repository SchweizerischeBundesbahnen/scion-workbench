SCION Workbench
===============

**The SCION Workbench provides a workbench layout for Angular applications similar to the Eclipse Workbench for Eclipse RCP applications.** 

Workbench layouts are useful for applications with non-linear workflows where users want to flexibly view and edit content in parallel. Examples include specialized business applications, scientific or development tools, as well as command & control interfaces.

A workbench layout allows the user to arrange and resize parts of the application using drag and drop. The layout consists of a view area and can define border panes. In the view area, the user can view or edit content in views. A view has a handle which the user can grab to arrange views side by side in a grid or move views to other locations in the grid. Border panes provide the user with additional information or context-sensitive assistance.
