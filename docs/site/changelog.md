## Changelog

Please choose from the following changelogs:

***
- [**@scion/workbench**][changelog-workbench]
- [**@scion/workbench-client**][changelog-workbench-client]
***

We generate separate changelogs for the packages `@scion/workbench` and `@scion/workbench-client` because of their independent release cycles. For instance, the SCION Workbench follows the same SemVer philosophy as Angular, with major versions being released at the same time as major versions of the Angular framework. In contrast, the SCION Workbench Client is independent of the Angular project, and we expect a more moderate release cycle than the SCION Workbench. We are particularly aware that you need stability from the SCION Workbench Client, primarily because microfrontends with different lifecycles are involved.
