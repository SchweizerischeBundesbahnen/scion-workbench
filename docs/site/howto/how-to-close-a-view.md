#### How to close a view

A view can be closed in three ways:
- by the user if closing the view tab (if the view is closable)
- in the view component via `WorkbenchView` handle
- via view navigation

#### Closing the current view
Inject `WorkbenchView` handle and invoke `close` method.

```typescript
@Component({...})
export class PersonComponent {

 constructor(private view: WorkbenchView) {
 }

 public onClose(): void {
   this.view.close();
 }
}
```

#### Closing view(s) via navigation
Views can also be closed via router. This is useful if having to close views outside of a view context, e.g. when deleting some data to close related views.

Navigate to the views to be closed with the flag `closeIfPresent` set to `true`.

Similar to when opening a view, closing can be done from within a template or via router service.

 ```html
<a [wbRouterLink]="[...]" [wbRouterLinkExtras]="{closeIfPresent: true}">
```

```typescript
const extras: WbNavigationExtras = {closeIfPresent: true};
workbenchRouter.navigate([...], extras);
```
